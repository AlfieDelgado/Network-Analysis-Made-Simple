      "One useful way of thinking by using generative models of random graphs. By \"generative\" and \"random\", we mean that the graph was generated using some statistical random model underlying it. This is essentially in the \"Bayesian\" tradition of modelling,.\n",
      "\n",
      "The alternative is a non-parametric way of thinking. This is where we don't assume some model that generated the data, and instead performs randomization on the data on hand to calculate statistics. Here, we assume that our randomization procedure is an appropriate random model for the network."
